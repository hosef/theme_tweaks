Theme Tweaks
======================

The Theme Tweaks module is designed to be a replacement for the Color module.
The Current version of the Color module has not been updated since Drupal 5 and
has a lot of obsolete code to handle functionality from before CSS supported
gradients or rounded corners.

The module also uses the config system instead of hard coded arrays. Because of
this, the module should work without any support from the theme being used,
however the theme should provide default values anyway to simplify the setup
process for users.
